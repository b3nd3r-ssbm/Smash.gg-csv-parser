# Smash.gg csv parser
 A way to quickly compile data from smash.gg results csvs
# How to use
Place the executable in a folder with your smash.gg csvs. Make sure that, when sorted in alphabetical order, the csvs are in the order you want them. In addition, put a txt file called "name.txt" in the folder and write your tournament series name in it. Then just run the executable!
# Run from source
You can also run it from the source if you have node.js installed. Put csvs in the same folder as the source, put your tournament name in name.txt and navigate to the folder in node.js command prompt. Then just run "npm start"!
